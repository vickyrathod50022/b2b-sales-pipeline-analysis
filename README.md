## 📈 Key Insights

### 1. Sales Team Performance

- **Top-performing agents**:
  - Melvin Marxen – **$2.25M** (highest contributor)

  - Longer deal cycles  
  - Product, regional, or experience-related challenges  

---

### 3. Quarter-over-Quarter & Seasonal Trends
- Sales show clear **seasonality**.
- **High-performing months:** June, September, December  
- **Consistent dips:** April, July, October  
- Quarter-level insights:
  - **Q2:** Strong growth with a peak in June  
  - **Q3:** Recovery after a July dip

---

### 4. Product Performance

  - GTX Pro – **17.1%**
- **Lower-contributing products**:
  - GTX Plus Pro – **11.1%**
  - GTX Plus Basic – **15.7%**
- Entry-level products outperform premium offerings, likely due to pricing sensitivity and shorter decision cycles.

---

## ✅ Recommendations

1. **Replicate Top Performer Strategies**
   - Analyze top agents’ product mix, regions, and deal velocity.
   - Share best practices across the sales team.

2. **Support Low Performers**
   - Provide targeted coaching and mentoring.
   - Review stalled deal stages and rebalance account allocation if required.

3. **Plan for Seasonality**
   - Strengthen pipeline generation before traditionally weak months.
   - Run sales acceleration initiatives during mid-quarter dips.

4. **Optimize Product Strategy**
   - Use GTX Basic as an entry-level product to acquire new customers.
   - Cross-sell and upsell premium products to existing clients.
   - Train agents on value-based selling for high-priced products.

## Future Work

The current analysis is based on data from **March 2017 to December 2017**. For further analysis, **Year-over-Year (YoY)** data can be included to identify long-term patterns and trends.

By analyzing multiple years of data, we can determine whether the **weak performance observed in April, June, and October** represents a consistent seasonal trend across years or a one-time quarterly trend specific to **2017**. This extended analysis would provide deeper insights into seasonality and help improve forecasting and strategic decision-making.

---

## 🧾 Conclusion
The analysis highlights performance gaps, seasonal sales behavior, and product-level opportunities that can directly support **revenue growth and sales optimization**.
